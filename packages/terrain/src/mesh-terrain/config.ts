 * deciding *detail* and a poor one for deciding *existence*: it left five LOD
 * levels selecting between each other inside one kilometre while everything
 * beyond was one flat approximation with its own colours and its own silhouette.
 *
 * The measured cost of the levels this actually adds is what makes reaching the
 * world edge the better default. Past roughly 520 m the screen-error rule picks
 * the coarsest level for everything, and a section there compiles in 1.2 ms and
 * occupies 5 KB with 72 source triangles. Holding the entire shipped 4 km world
 * is about 1,000 sections, 13 MB and 210k triangles -- less geometry than the
 * old disc was already drawing, because the disc spent its budget on levels
 * that were finer than the distance justified.
 *
 * The section ceiling is what keeps this honest for a world too large to hold.
 * A 16 km world is 16,384 sections and does not fit; there the radius falls back
 * to what does fit and the proxy resumes its original job beyond it.
