/**
 * The floor each forest preset grows on.
 *
 * A stand's ground is as much a part of what it is as its canopy, and until
 * now every preset in the editor opened on the same one: deep broadleaf litter
 * with bracken, fern, bramble and wood rush on it. Under a spruce plantation
 * that is wrong in every particular — the floor there is a fine, even, almost
 * black felt of needles that suppresses nearly everything, with moss where the
 * light gets in. On a savanna it is dry earth and bleached bunchgrass. Getting
 * the floor wrong costs more than getting the trees wrong, because the floor is
 * most of the lower half of every eye-level frame.
 *
 * Three tiers in each, deliberately, because that is the structure a real
 * ground cover has and the one thing a single painted species can never
 * produce:
 *
 *   - the surface itself — litter, duff, moss film, bare earth,
 *   - a low mat that runs continuously over it,
 *   - a mid layer of grasses, ferns and herbs standing in it,
 *   - and a sparse tall layer that breaks the silhouette above both.
 *
 * The counts are colonies, not plants. Each one becomes a soft brush dab at
 * well under full flow, so they overlap into genuine mixtures with incomplete
 * edges instead of stacking as decals.
